# üìÑ PageIndex

Are you frustrated with vector database retrieval accuracy for long professional documents? Traditional vector-based RAG relies on semantic *similarity* rather than true *relevance*. But what we really need in retrieval is **relevance** ‚Äî which requires **reasoning**. When working with professional documents that demand domain expertise and multi-step reasoning, similarity search often falls short.

**Reasoning-based RAG** offers a better alternative: enabling LLMs to *think* and *reason* their way to the most relevant document sections. Inspired by AlphaGo, we propose to use  *tree search* to perform structured document retrieval.

**[PageIndex](https://vectify.ai/pageindex)** is a *document indexing system* that builds *search tree structures* from long documents, making them ready for reasoning-based RAG. 

Built by [Vectify AI](https://vectify.ai/pageindex).

# **‚≠ê What is PageIndex**

PageIndex can transform lengthy PDF documents into a semantic **tree structure**, similar to a *"table of contents"* but optimized for use with Large Language Models (LLMs).
It‚Äôs ideal for: financial reports, regulatory filings, academic textbooks, legal or technical manuals, and any document that exceeds LLM context limits.

### ‚úÖ Key Features
    
- **Hierarchical Tree Structure**  
  Enables LLMs to traverse documents logically ‚Äî like an intelligent, LLM-optimized table of contents.

- **Precise Page Referencing**  
  Every node contains its summary and start/end page physical index, allowing pinpoint retrieval.

- **Chunk-Free Segmentation**  
  No arbitrary chunking. Nodes follow the natural structure of the document.

- **Scales to Massive Documents**  
  Designed to handle hundreds or even thousands of pages with ease.

### üì¶ PageIndex Format

Here is an example output. See more [example documents](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/tree/main/docs) and [generated trees](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/tree/main/results).

```
...
{
  "title": "Financial Stability",
  "node_id": "0006",
  "start_index": 21,
  "end_index": 22,
  "summary": "The Federal Reserve ...",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "title": "Monitoring Financial Vulnerabilities",
      "node_id": "0007",
      "start_index": 22,
      "end_index": 28,
      "summary": "The Federal Reserve's monitoring ..."
    },
    {
      "title": "Domestic and International Cooperation and Coordination",
      "node_id": "0008",
      "start_index": 28,
      "end_index": 31,
      "summary": "In 2023, the Federal Reserve collaborated ..."
    }
  ]
}
...
```

# üöÄ Package Usage

Follow these steps to generate a PageIndex tree from a PDF document.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set your OpenAI API key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```bash
CHATGPT_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 3. Run PageIndex on your PDF

```bash
python3 run_pageindex.py --pdf_path /path/to/your/document.pdf
```
You can customize the processing with additional optional arguments:

```bash
--model                 OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4o-2024-11-20)
--toc-check-pages       Pages to check for table of contents (default: 20)
--max-pages-per-node    Max pages per node (default: 10)
--max-tokens-per-node   Max tokens per node (default: 20000)
--if-add-node-id        Add node ID (yes/no, default: yes)
--if-add-node-summary   Add node summary (yes/no, default: no)
--if-add-doc-description Add doc description (yes/no, default: yes)
```

# üìà Case Study: Mafin 2.5

[Mafin 2.5](https://vectify.ai/blog/Mafin2.5) is a state-of-the-art reasoning-based RAG model designed specifically for financial document analysis. Built on top of **PageIndex**, it achieved an impressive **98.7% accuracy** on the [FinanceBench](https://github.com/VectifyAI/Mafin2.5-FinanceBench) benchmark ‚Äî significantly outperforming traditional vector-based RAG systems.

PageIndex‚Äôs hierarchical indexing enabled precise navigation and extraction of relevant content from complex financial reports, such as SEC filings and earnings disclosures.

# üß† Reasoning-Based RAG with PageIndex

Use PageIndex to build **reasoning-based retrieval systems** without relying on semantic similarity. Great for domain-specific tasks where nuance matters.

### üîñ Preprocessing Workflow Example
1. Process documents using PageIndex to generate tree structures.
2. Store the tree structures and their corresponding document IDs in a database table.
3. Store the contents of each node in a separate table, indexed by node ID and tree ID.

### üîñ Reasoning-Based RAG Framework Example
1. Query Preprocessing:
    - Analyze the query to identify the required knowledge
2. Document Selection: 
    - Search for relevant documents and their IDs
    - Fetch the corresponding tree structures from the database
3. Node Selection:
    - Search through tree structures to identify relevant nodes
4. LLM Generation:
    - Fetch the corresponding contents of the selected nodes from the database
    - Format and extract the relevant information
    - Send the assembled context along with the original query to the LLM
    - Generate contextually informed responses


### üîñ Example Prompt for Node Selection

```python
prompt = f"""
You are given a question and a tree structure of a document.
You need to find all nodes that are likely to contain the answer.

Question: {question}

Document tree structure: {structure}

Reply in the following JSON format:
{{
    "thinking": <reasoning about where to look>,
    "node_list": [node_id1, node_id2, ...]
}}
"""
```
